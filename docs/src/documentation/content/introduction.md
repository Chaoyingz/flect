## Introduction

Welcome to the flect framework documentation!

### What is flect?

flect is a Python framework for building full-stack web applications. It constructs user interfaces by utilizing Pydantic
models in the backend that correspond to the properties of React components in the frontend. This integration enables
quick development of interactive and beautiful UIs using Python.

The key features are:

- **Fast development**: Write your entire app with Python, seamlessly integrating backend logic and frontend UI.
- **Easy Form Validation**: Define a single Pydantic model for seamless and consistent form validation across your app, enhancing development speed and reducing potential errors.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Fast, smooth page transitions without reloads.
- **Folder-Based Routing**: Easy route management through folder structure.
- **SEO Friendly**: Supports server-side rendering for better search engine visibility.

This project is inspired by the [FastUI](https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI) and [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

## Why use flect?

flect enables developers to harness the combined power of Python and JavaScript ecosystems, facilitating the creation of web applications with efficiency and ease:

> If you're a Python developer — you can build responsive web applications using React without writing a single line of JavaScript, or touching npm.
>
> If you're a frontend developer — you can concentrate on building magical components that are truly reusable, no copy-pasting components for each view.
>
> For everyone — a true separation of concerns, the backend defines the entire application; while the frontend is free to implement just the user interface.
>
> — _From FastUI_
