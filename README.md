Use Pydantic models in the backend that correspond to the properties of React components in the frontend. This enables you to quickly develop interactive and beautiful UIs using Python.

The key features are:

- **Fast development**: Write your entire app with Python, seamlessly integrating backend logic and frontend UI.
- **SEO Friendly**: Supports server-side rendering for better search engine visibility.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Fast, smooth page transitions without reloads.
- **Folder-Based Routing**: Easy route management through folder structure.
