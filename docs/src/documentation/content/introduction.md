## Introduction

Welcome to the tui framework documentation!

### What is tui?

tui is a Python framework for building full-stack web applications. It constructs user interfaces by utilizing Pydantic
models in the backend that correspond to the properties of React components in the frontend. This integration enables
quick development of interactive and beautiful UIs using Python.

The key features are:

- **Fast development**: Write your entire app with Python, seamlessly integrating backend logic and frontend UI.
- **SEO Friendly**: Supports server-side rendering for better search engine visibility.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Fast, smooth page transitions without reloads.
- **Folder-Based Routing**: Easy route management through folder structure.
- **Easy Form Validation**: Define a single Pydantic model for seamless and consistent form validation across your app, enhancing development speed and reducing potential errors.

This is inspired by the [FastUI](https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI) framework.
