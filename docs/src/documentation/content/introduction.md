## Introduction

Welcome to the flect framework documentation!

### What is flect?

flect is a Python framework for building full-stack web applications. It constructs user interfaces by utilizing Pydantic
models in the backend that correspond to the properties of React components in the frontend. This integration enables
quick development of interactive and beautiful UIs using Python.

The key features are:

- **Fast development**: Write your entire app with Python, seamlessly integrating backend logic and frontend UI.
- **Easy Form Validation**: Define a single Pydantic model for seamless and consistent form validation across your app, enhancing development speed and reducing potential errors.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Fast, smooth page transitions without reloads.
- **Folder-Based Routing**: Easy route management through folder structure.
- **SEO Friendly**: Supports server-side rendering for better search engine visibility.

This is inspired by the [FastUI](https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI) framework.
